    <p><a href=""><b>Opera</b></a> refers to a dramatic art form, originating in <u>Europe</u>, 
    in which the emotional content is conveyed to the audience as much through <i>music</i>, 
    both vocal and instrumental, as it is through the <i>lyrics</i>. By contrast, 
    in musical theater an actor's dramatic performance is primary, and the music plays a lesser role.
    The drama in opera is presented using the primary elements of theater such as scenery, costumes, 
    and acting. However, the words of the opera, or libretto, are sung rather than spoken. 
    The singers are accompanied by a musical ensemble ranging from a small instrumental ensemble to a 
    full symphonic orchestra.</p>
